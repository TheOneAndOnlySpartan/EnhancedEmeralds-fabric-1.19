# Enhanced Emeralds Mod

## Description

    This mod aims to add much more functionality than trading to the emeralds. 
    The idea is that you can Enrich/Enhance/Fill emeralds with experience via some sort of machine that will use Solid Experience Blocks/Items from the get go
    Eventually you will upgrade the machine or maybe craft other machines that can use liquid experience or essence (like Bottles of Experience) to be able to fill the emeralds.
    And tha last upgrade/machine will be powered with _magic_ and use Experience orbs nearby the machine to fill the emeralds

## State Of The Mod
